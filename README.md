I have finished the OOP part and am currently looking at front end dev. I have so far uploaded my 2 / 3 hours of working and mostly reading documentations while trying to understand them. CSS I am undertsanidng more and right now is to make mt rectangle with "Hello World" in it move acording to my WASD key presses. So far I am not succeding so I need to break this problem into smaller ones. For now I will try and make my code undertsand which key I am pressing by using the "AddEventListener" and recording the key press with "console.log()".

I have solved the issue with the event listener. it is a bit embarrassing, I had to ad 'keyDown' to the function. Next step is to create an element that moves and change its direction depending on the key input. I will have to chage basically constantly change its X,Y coordinates by adding or subtracting a value by me.
