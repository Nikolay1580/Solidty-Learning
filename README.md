I have finished the OOP part and am currently looking at front end dev. I have so far uploaded my 2 / 3 hours of working and mostly reading documentations while trying to understand them. CSS I am undertsanidng more and right now is to make mt rectangle with "Hello World" in it move acording to my WASD key presses. So far I am not succeding so I need to break this problem into smaller ones. For now I will try and make my code undertsand which key I am pressing by using the "AddEventListener" and recording the key press with "console.log()".

I have solved the issue with the event listener. it is a bit embarrassing, I had to ad 'keyDown' to the function. Next step is to create an element that moves and change its direction depending on the key input. I will have to chage basically constantly change its X,Y coordinates by adding or subtracting a value by me.

I have began learning some of the basic syntax for Solidity. This includes the unit256 and what it means and the newest thing for me.. the "visibility" data can be. By default all data is "internal" meaning that it can be used by all components within the smart contract. There are 3 other types, "public", "external" and "private" which all have their own uses and differences. External and private being polar opposites. So far it is easy and I am understanding a bit more about Solidity and OOP in general making me more comfortable with understanding how it works.

I have begun to do more with inheritance even though I haven't yet published, I have begun working with sending funds to other accounts which is the core of creating a dap. If A happens send x amount of WEI (Etherium's smallest form of currency) else do not send anything. It is getting a bit overwhelming for me but with breaks and time to revise and go back onto older material to make sure this is not going to fast, everything should be alright. I can't wait to create one day my own crypto coin, DAPP or both!
